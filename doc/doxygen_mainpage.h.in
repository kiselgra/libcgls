 *
 *
 * 	The cgls library is an extension to the more basic cgl library.
 *  The name is cgl plus s, for scheme (in both senses).
 *  
 *  As cgl strives to provide means, cgls implements a certain policy on top of it.
 *  The primitives of cgl, directly mapping to opengl constructs, are extended by logical constructs tying them together.
 *  
 *  The most central elements are the notion 
 *  	\li of drawelemtns (see \ref drawelement.h) which consisting of a set of data for rendering (e.g. a mesh with shaders...),
 *      \li of materials (see \ref material.h) which describe objects' surface properties (e.g. holding textures and color information), 
 *  	\li of a scene (see \ref scene.h) and accordingly some limited support for scene graphs, and
 *  	\li the stock shading methods (see \ref stock-shader.h).
 *
 *	All structures and methods are provided for use from C and Scheme.
 *  
 *	The framework is supposed to be easily adaptable to special rendering needs. Let's see how this plays out :)
